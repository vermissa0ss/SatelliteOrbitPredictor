						SatelliteOrbitPredictor

This package’s goal is to propagate the orbit of current satellite’s for the next 12 hours. This module contains all unclassified NAVSTAR satellites currently in orbit. 


This package can be imported by:
from plot import plot_orbit


Inputs: Satellite ID, graphType

The satellite ID’s can be obtained by examining the ID’s of each satellite posted by NAVSTAR. The satellite ID will be in the from “KEY #” eg. “PRN 20”. Besides putting in a satellite name as a string, the function plot_orbit.get_all_graphs() can be called with no inputs to plot all the NAVSTAR satellites. 

There are 3 different graphType inputs. First, is “GroundTracks”, which plots the ground tracks of the specific satellites orbit for the next 12 hours on a flat map of the earth. The next input option is “3d” in which the orbit is plotted on a 3D globe of the earth. The final plotting option is “Animation” in which the orbit trajectory is animated across its ground tracks. 

Example: plot_orbit.plot_specific_orbit(“PRN 20”, Animation)
plot_orbit.get_all_graphs()


Output:
Graphic of propagated orbit
Graphic exported as .html file to current working directory
