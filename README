					SatelliteOrbitPredictor
This package’s goal is to propagate the orbit of current satellite’s for the next 12 hours. 
This module contains all unclassified NAVSTAR satellites currently in orbit. 
The output of this function is the plot of the orbit propagation as ground-tracks, 3D, or as an animated ground-track.
These are the key inputs to the main plot function, plot_specific_orbit. The output will be an interactive plot saved to the current directory as an .html file.
